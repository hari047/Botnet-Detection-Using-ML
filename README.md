# Botnet-Detection-Using-ML

## • Built a Botnet Detector that applies Deep Learning to assess a dataset and train itself to identify the existence of bots in a network by analyzing the IRC traffic using the signatures of bots.

## • Programmed a flow-based feature system, that performs with different accuracies based on the algorithm being chosen for classification. Test reports showed that Boosted Trees (82.2%) turned out to be the most accurate, followed by Random Forest (78%) and Logistic Regression (60.85%).
